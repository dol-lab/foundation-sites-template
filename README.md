# Foundation for Sites Template

This originally was built using [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file for you.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm run start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.


## To Do

* Revisit color-mix declarations. Most of them have fallbacks, some do not, especially when declared through scss variables.
* Revisit text sizing.
* Increase global border-radius settings.
